# Project: RollBuddy


## Idea

Our project proposes to create an application that allows D&D5E players to create or import characters, track changing aspects to the character through multiple play sessions, and view character information in an intuitive UI. Most importantly, it will also tell players what their bonuses are to various kinds of rolls, allow players to actually simulate rolling the dice within the application, and automatically apply the modifiers to display the final result.


## Goals

Major Features:



1. Create a character and populate necessary numeric fields during creation (or import info); character info persists across sessions.
2. Level up a character, updating stats, abilities, and dice modifiers as appropriate
3. Perform combat rolls, including saving throws, AC checks, to-hit rolls, and damage rolls, all with appropriate dice and modifiers.
4. Perform ability check dice rolls with appropriate dice and modifiers.
5. Perform spell rolls, including spell checks and spell damage, with appropriate dice and modifiers.

Stretch Goals:



1. Update numbers upon certain events (e.g. - gaining experience or gold, taking damage, receive a buff/debuff)
2. Save multiple characters
3. New to D&D vs Power User interface
